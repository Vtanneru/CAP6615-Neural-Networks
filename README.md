# CAP6615-Neural-Networks

This is a repo for the Neural Networks course project (CAP 6615). It includes applications of Single-Layer Perceptron (SLP) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for alphanumeric image recognition (see HW1 and HW2), and applications of CNN and RNN in s&p 500 price short-term prediction (see HW3 and HW4).
